A Bash / Shell script to convert your PNG images into
Mac OS specific type ICNS (iconset) !

## Image Requirements

- Format should be PNG (transparency isn't mandatory).
- Dimensions need to be **1024x1024** pixels.

## Image Recommendations

- A transparent background will be removed
  (as with the cat icon above)
- Icons with a background generally do no fill the entire 1024x1024 space.
  They are usually inset by about 50px on each side.
  The _rounded-rect-inset.png_ file in this repo provides a template
  that matches the style of many other icons:
  it's a white rounded-rectangle with a transparent border.
  Center your icon within the template, then use the procedure below.

## How to Use

1. Letâ€™s get started by downloading the project,
and move into the newly created folder:

   ```shell
   > git clone https://github.com/BenSouchet/png-to-icns.git
   Cloning into 'png-to-icns'...
   
   > cd png-to-icns
   ```

   Or copy/paste the script file `png_to_icns.sh` in a directory

2. Optionally: Place the **1024x1024** pixels image (`.png`)
you want to convert in the folder
3. Start the script and give the path to the image with
`-i image_path`

   ```shell
   > ./png_to_icns.sh -i <path_to_my_image.png>
   INFO: The icon has been successfully created: ./icon.icns
   ```

4. Done! The new icon has been created, the path of this `.icns`
is indicate on the info message in your terminal.
